## Hi there 👋, I'm Eduardo Rocha

#### 🎓 Software Engineering Master's student at the University of Minho
#### 👨🏻‍💻 Currently doing an internship at AmeXio Portugal, focusing on multi-agent systems and text analysis
#### 💻 I love exploring new technologies and building cool stuff

The projects you'll find here are mainly university assignments or personal side-projects — things I’ve built to learn, experiment, or just for fun :)
